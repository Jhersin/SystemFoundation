Binary Detectability in Undersampled MR Reconstruction

Repository Description
This project investigates binary lesion detectability in undersampled MR images using zero-filled reconstructions. Simulated elliptical lesions were embedded in gray matter, and detection performance was evaluated with Hotelling-based model observers. We systematically explored the effects of acceleration, noise level, lesion size, and amplitude on detectability. Results were compared against conventional metrics like SSIM and MSE, revealing a low-to-moderate correlation and underscoring the importance of task-based assessment for clinically relevant MR reconstruction.
