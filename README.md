# Project BIO580 - Binary Detectability in MR Reconstruction

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed anatomical images, but acquiring high-quality images can be time-consuming. Acceleration techniques that skip k-space lines are commonly used to reduce acquisition time, but this leads to image artifacts and loss of diagnostic information.

This project explores **binary detectability** in undersampled MRI reconstructions using **Hotelling Observer (HO)** and **Channelized Hotelling Observer (CHO)** models. The focus is to evaluate how acceleration, noise, and lesion characteristics affect the ability to detect small structures in reconstructed images‚Äîgoing beyond traditional metrics such as SSIM and MSE.

## üî¨ Problem Setup

We simulate elliptical lesions embedded in background patches to model signal-present and signal-absent conditions under varying noise and acceleration levels.

### Hypotheses

- **Signal Present (H‚ÇÅ):**
g‚ÇÅ = H(f‚Çõ + f_b) + n
- **Signal Absent (H‚ÇÇ):**
g‚ÇÇ = H(f_b) + n

Where:
- `f‚Çõ`: signal (elliptical lesion)  
- `f_b`: background  
- `n`: additive noise  
- `H`: reconstruction operator (model)

## üß† Hotelling Observer

The Hotelling observer template is defined as:
W_hot = [0.5 * (K‚ÇÅ + K‚ÇÇ)]‚Åª¬π ¬∑ (E[g‚ÇÅ] - E[g‚ÇÇ])

- `K‚ÇÅ`, `K‚ÇÇ`: Covariance matrices under hypotheses H‚ÇÅ and H‚ÇÇ  
- `E[g‚ÇÅ]`, `E[g‚ÇÇ]`: Mean vectors of signal-present and signal-absent images

The test statistic for a given patch `g` is:

t_hot = W_hot·µÄ ¬∑ g



This allows us to compute the **AUC** and evaluate detectability performance across varying conditions.

## üìä Metrics

While traditional metrics like:

- **MSE** ‚Äì Average pixel-wise error  
- **SSIM** ‚Äì Structural Similarity Index
- **AUC_HO** - AUC for hotelling observer
- **AUC_CHO** - AUC for hotelling observer
  
are included, this project emphasizes **task-based** metrics like AUC derived from observer models, which are more aligned with clinical goals.
